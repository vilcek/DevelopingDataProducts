#### About SMS Spam Detector

SMS Spam Detector is an R application of the [Naive Bayes Classifier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) for the identification of SMS spam messages.  
It uses the [SMS Spam Collection](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection) data set, available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository, to train and test the classifier model.

The application is fully parameterized, meaning that you can play with the most important parameters that control both data preparation and model training.

It also includes parameterized [word cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud) and [data table](http://datatables.net/) visualizations of the data set.

A companion presentation for this application can be found [here](http://rpubs.com/vilcek/sms_spam_detector).
